        <div class="subheading mb-5">Accounting üìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Erin Liz Araza and I am currently a first-year Business Administration student at University of California, Riverside. I aim to have my concentration in accounting and later acquire a job at a well-known firm. I have previoius experience in a retail setting, which has allowed me to grow accustomed to various types of customer interaction. It has also expanded on my skills as a collaborator through working with a group of 10 other co-workers to keep the store profitable and efficient. Furthermore, I have experience having been an intern at a private college where I administered several secretarial duties that assisted upper management in communicating with other employees and ensured the workplace was productive. Additionally, I have volunteered as a tutor as a part of the World Family Children Foundation's ‚ÄúYoung Mentors‚Äù initiative, in which I aided students from low-income areas who were struggling in school. I have also dedicated time as a member to the ChallengeHer Leadership Program, where I headed and participated in volunteer efforts that included arranging music to be played for the elderly, cleaning up polluted areas, as well as creating and distributing care packages to a local homeless shelter. As part of this program, I had to create and present displays that highlighted the positive effects these projects had on our community.<br><br>

        From these experiences, I would consider myself proficient in customer service as well as adept in creating and adhering to an organized schedule. Another skill I feel confident in sharing is my ability to plan and manage social events, especially with additional coordination by my peers. Moreover, based on my time spent in a retail setting as well as educational courses I have taken in college, I can easily adapt to different kinds of technology in order to perform any task that I am assigned. As I continue through my college career and plan to start an internship as a Pearson Campus Ambassador this school year, I intend to expand on these skills and gain new ones that will further prepare me for a successful carrer in the business world.<br><br>

        A way in which I have started progress toward this goal is by recently joining an organization known as the Future Business Leaders of America. After applying and interviewing, I was able to earn a position on the programming committee. A main responsibility that I carry as a member is planning social and professional events for the club and future members to attend. This includes careful consideration of factors such as budget, timing, equipment, and marketing. The main goal of the club is to help students like me who are interested in the business field so I look forward to being a long-standing member and the experience I will gain from putting work into the organization. Going forward, I am interested in joining an additional organization that also centers around business, but more closely focused on accounting. I appreciate the time you have taken to read this description and I hope it has given you a better understanding of who I am and what I hope to do in the future.
